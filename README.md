# Serokell Scratchpad

This repository contains a ragtag collection of scripts and snippets.

Notable mentions include:

* A script to generate a Packet-compatible nix expression for network
  configuration from terraform output
* A standalone `nixos-rebuild` script, since that's not included in the
  standalone Nix distribution
* A Terraform deployment and Nix configuration for a beefy remote builder on
  Packet

Each notable folder has its own readme explaining purpose and usage of the things therein.
