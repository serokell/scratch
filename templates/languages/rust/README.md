# Rust project template

This should set you up for Rust development with Nix.

## Usage

Uses [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv) for dependency management.

Run `cargo new` as you would, then copy all these files into the project
folder. Edit `default.nix` to set the Rust channel you want to use. `nix-shell`
will set you up for development.
